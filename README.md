!!Add TOS and privacy policy.!!

Very useful discord bot to tell if someone you are in comms with is streaming to twitch. Store twitch usernames with:
```
!setTwitch <Twitch username>
!setotherTwitch <user_id#> <username>
```

and the bot checks if they are live streaming every 30 seconds. Assigns a unicorn emoji in front of their nickname if streaming, and removes when done streaming.

I will add more streaming services in the future, but for now just twitch since I made this last night. Ensure to give it proper roles to edit nicknames and then its all set.

add Streamer Status bot to your server:
